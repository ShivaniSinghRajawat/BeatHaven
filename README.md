 I am creating an project about music genre segmentation, mainly inspired by spotify, where based on answers taken from the users in the quiz ;we will suggest them songs, personalized playlists, there will also be the game where you can sing along like karaoke and in the end you will be graded and an score will be given , making it more fun.
 It will be a unique platform designed to provide users with a personalized music experience. Through an interactive quiz, users can identify their preferred genres and receive tailored recommendations for songs and playlists. The platform also features a fun and engaging karaoke game where users can sing along to their favorite tunes and receive a score. With this, users can discover new music, and enjoy a personalized and interactive music experience.
